# Library-Catalogue
This catalogue provides a record of all of the books that I own and information about them for quick reference. 

The Project
------------
I started this project because I wanted a digital record of the books that I own. This project will allow me to track books that I own and information about them for quick reference. It will also allow me to easily share information about my books with other people, track the location of my books, and it will act as a backup in case anything ever happens to my books or I am forced to get rid of them at short notice. 

These files are primarily intended for my own use. However, all are welcome to access, share, remix, and revise my work under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 Licence (See licence information below). 

Features
---------
This project contains three files: an .XSD schema, the .XML source file, and a .CSS file. 

The XSD file defines rules for the XML language that I am using. 

The XML file contains a record of all of the books in my personal collection. Books are divided into two categories: Fiction and Non-Fiction. Within each section, books are sorted by authorâ€™s last name. If I have multiple books by one author, books are organized by publication date. For each book, I include the following information: The authorâ€™s name, book title, number of pages, whether the book is hard or soft cover, my rating of the book, the number of times I have read the book, the last time I read the book, where the book is currently located, keywords, and any additional notes I have for the book.

The CSS file defines how a browser should display the information in the XML file.

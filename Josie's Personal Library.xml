    <intro>
        <p>I created this catalogue to keep track of my personal collection of books. It's divided into two sections: Fiction and Non-Fiction. All of my fictional books are organized by author, and all of my non-fictional books are organized into subjects and sub-subjects.</p>
        <p>I created this repository as part of a final assignment for ENGL 407, a class on XML at the UNiversity of Victoria. I chose this project because I wanted a system that would allow me to keep track of the location of my books, the last time I read them, how many times I've read them, how I came to have these books, and anything else that might be relevant. As such, this is a very personal project. However, it will also allow me to easily share my collection with anyone who cares to know, and will act as a record in case I am forced to get rid of my books or if they are lost for any reason.</p>
        <p>A copy of the XML, XSD, CSS, and README files that go with this project can be accessed from my GitHub account. You can find that at https://github.com/josiegray/Library-Catalogue.</p>

The book traces the development of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque architecture, and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory and village against the backdrop of historical events of the time.</summary>

                    <summary>We Were Liars focuses on the theme of self-acceptance, family morals, and the possibly-deadly consequences of one's mistakes. It is centered on the wealthy, seemingly perfect Sinclair family, who spend every summer gathered on their private island. However, not every summer is the sameâ€”when something happens to Cadence during the summer of her fifteenth year, the four "Liars" (Cadence, Johnny, Gat and Mirren) re-emerge two years later to prompt Cadence to remember the incident.</summary>

                        <p>This book was assigned by Karen Rivers in her class on Writing for Children and Young Adults (WRIT 406). Although I remember not really enjoying the book, the twist ending makes it all worth it. This book is heartbreaking and has the potential to make you cry.</p>

                        <p>I read the first book in this series a long time ago. So I can't remember what happened. But I think it was a good one. I never ended up reading the second.</p>

                        <p>I have read the first book and half of the second in this series. The story contains so many points of view and characters that it hard to follow. I'll try reading them all again when I have time to spend a lot of time reading. I want to be able to read the books before I watch the TV shows.</p>

                        <rating>3 - Like, but probably won't read again</rating>
                        <summary>While working as a journalist in Somalia, Amanda and a man she is working with are captured and held for ransom for fifteen months. This book is a memoir of Amanda's life leading up to and including her time in captivity.</summary>

                            <p>This book was extremely interesting, but hard to read at times. Grandpa Gray gave it to me. I don't think he read it, but Amanda grew up in Red Deer, Alberta, so he would have read about her story in the news.</p>
                            <p>I lent this book out to Tokai before Christmas (2017). He still has it.</p>
